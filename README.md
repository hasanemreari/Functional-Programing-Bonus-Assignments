Question 5's Answer:
The number of weeks is not an integer value in 400 years. It is 365 days a year, and it means 52 weeks 
and 1.25 days at the same time.Calculated as 400 * 1.25 for the remaining days, it is 500 days. The week 
in the previous result is 71 weeks and 3 days.As a result, the number of weeks is not an integer value, 
since there are extra days.However, the days of the week coincide with the same day every 35 years. 
This shows that the likelihood of all days is equal for 385 years.But this is not the same for 400 days.
